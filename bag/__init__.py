Currently, the library requires Python 2.6.x.

Library contents
================

    * csv -- The infamous csv Python module does not support unicode; problem solved.
    * file_id_manager -- Use this to hash your files, store the hashes, and know when you already have some file.
    * file_watcher -- Watches a bunch of files and when one of them is modified, runs a callback. Also useful for reloading Python modules when they are altered.
    * google_translator -- Use the Google translation webservice to translate text.
    * html -- Encode and decode HTML and XML entities.
    * more_codecs -- Got text in some weird encoding that Python doesn't know? OK, use iconv to decode it.
    * percentage_done -- Don't leave your user wondering if your program is hanging; print the percentage of work done every few seconds.
    * sa -- Convenient SQLALchemy initialization, and some types for working with SQLite.
    * text -- Functions for working with unicode strings.
