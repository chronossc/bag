'''Advanced flash messages scheme for Pyramid.

Many people use the queues of flash messages to separate them by their level
(error, warning, info or success) in code such as this::

    request.session.flash(str(e), 'error')

The problem with this is that messages won't appear in the order in which
they were created. Because each queue is processed separately in the
template, order is lost and messages are grouped by kind.

Our solution: we store the level *with* the message, so you can create your
flash messages as bootstrap alerts *in a single queue* like this::

    from bag.web.pyramid.flash_msg import FlashMessage
    FlashMessage(request,
        "You can enqueue a message simply by instantiating a FlashMessage.",
        kind='warning')

An additional feature is available if you add this to your app initialization::

    config.include('bag.web.pyramid.flash_msg')

Then you can simply do, in templates:

    ${request.render_flash_messages()}

...to render the messages with Bootstrap styling.

If you don't like that I am generating HTML in Python, or if you just
want some additional styling, then you can just loop over the flash messages
in your template (now you only need one queue) and use
FlashMessage's instance variables to render the
bootstrap alerts just the way you want them.
